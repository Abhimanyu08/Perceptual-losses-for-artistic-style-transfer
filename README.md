# Perceptual-losses-for-artistic-style-transfer
An implementation of the the artistic style transfer algorithm put forward by Justin Johnson et.al in the paper "Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution"


The paper introduces a new algorithm for artistic style transfer which produces qualitatively identical results to the paper "Neural algorithm for artistic style" by Gatys et.al but in considerably less amount of time. I used the algorithm to convert colored photographs into pencil sketches by using a pencil sketch image as the style target.
